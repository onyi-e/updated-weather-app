# 🌤️ Updated Weather App

This is a responsive weather application built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. 
It allows users to search for the current weather in any city using live data from the [SheCodes Weather API](https://www.shecodes.io/learn/apis/weather). 
This project reflects my ongoing journey in front-end web development and includes layout and functionality improvements.
